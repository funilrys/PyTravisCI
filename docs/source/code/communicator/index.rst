Communicator
============

Communicators are sets of classes composed of methods which (actually) process
the communication between us and the Travis CI API.

They are not well documented on purpose because they are not meant for the
"grand public". Unless you have a good reason, you should never (directly) play
with them.

.. warning::
    Do not play with those classes unless you know what you are doing!
